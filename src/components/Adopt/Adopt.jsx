        <strong>How can I adopt from Special Dog?</strong>
                <p>
                  Applicants go through a screening process to ensure that our rescued animals go to loving homes.
                  The process includes an online interview via Zoom and at least two (2) separate shelter visits to meet and get to know your chosen pet.
                  Apply <a href="/adoption-application">here</a>.
                </p>

                <strong>Can you adopt my dog?</strong>
                <p>
                  Special Dog does NOT adopt owned pets. We already have 300+ shelter animals rescued from cruelty and neglect that are waiting to be adopted.
                  If you need to give up your pet for some reason, please consider other options or apply for rehoming assistance.
                </p>
<hr />
                <strong>Can my adoption application get denied?</strong>
                <p>
                  Yes. Some reasons for denied applications include: Not being able to keep their pet indoors, incompatibility with the household, plus other circumstances that may be damaging to the health, safety, and happiness of our shelter animals. 
                </p>
      </div>
      <div className="col-6">
      <strong>I live in the province/abroad. Can I still adopt?</strong>
              <p>
                Yes, but special arrangements need to be made for the meet-and-greet, depending on your location. Please contact us to discuss your options. You may also opt to adopt from your local pound instead.
              </p>
<hr />
              <strong>Can I adopt more than one pet?</strong>
              <p>
                 Some applicants may be approved to adopt more than one pet on a case to case basis, but especially if the animal you wish to adopt belongs to a bonded pair.
              </p>
<hr />
              <strong>Can I return my adopted pet if I change my mind?</strong>
              <p>
                 A pet is a lifetime commitment. However, if you truly can’t keep your adopted pet, please don’t abandon them on the streets or with strangers. Please return them to us so we can find another home for them.
